# sumplete-solver
## What is the purpose of this project?
This project aims to provide a fast and easy-to-use solver for [Sumplete](https://sumplete.com/).
You can access the solver [here]().

## What is Sumplete?
Sumplete is a logic puzzle.
### Input
* A square grid filled with numbers.
* Target sums for each row and column.
### Objective
Decide which numbers to keep and which to delete so that the remaining numbers in each row and column add up to their target sums.

You can read more about the rules from the link above to the original site.

## How to use the solver?

## What technologies were used to create the solver?
The solver is written in C++, using the Qt framework for implementing the GUI.

Utilization of C++ combined with a practical and efficient algorithm enables the solver to find a solution with great speed and minimal memory usage.
Modern C++ standard (C++23) helps keep the program safe, while not diminishing its efficiency.
