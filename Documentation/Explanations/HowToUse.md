# Solver Usage Instructions
This document aims to explain how to use the solver.

## Steps
1. Choose the puzzle size using the dropdown below the grid.
2. Fill all the cells of the grid, rows' sums and columns' sums.
    - Currently only filling the grid manually is possible.
    - In future versions it will be possible to upload puzzles by their ID.
3. Press the **solve** button.
    * If the grid is unsolvable, a relevant message pops.
    * If the grid is solvable, it will be colored with green and red: Green cells are included in the sum, while red ones are discarded.
